# gryan's vim

My vim setup, feel free to use.

Run `install.sh` to install from git repo directory. It will move your old .vim and .vimrc to .bak versions and replace them with symlinks from this repo.

basic usage:
hold down shift keys to move faster, ctrl keys to move slower. Press w before moving to switch windows.

`,` is leader.  `,w` to write, `,q` to quit.

`,c<space>` to comment/uncomment

`jk` or `JK` to escape insert mode.

See `.vimrc` for more special commands.
